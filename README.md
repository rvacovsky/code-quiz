# Code Quiz

## User Story

As a coding bootcamp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user clicks the start button on a coding quiz, a time starts and the user is presented with a question. When the user answers a question they are then presented with another question. When the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over. When the game is over, the user can save their initials and score.

## Built with:

* JavaScript
